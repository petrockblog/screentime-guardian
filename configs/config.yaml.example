# Screentime Guardian Configuration Example

# Web interface address
# Use ":8080" to listen on all interfaces
# Use "127.0.0.1:8080" for localhost only
listen_addr: ":8080"

# Database location
database_path: "/var/lib/screentime-guardian/data.db"

# Admin password for web interface
# IMPORTANT: Set a strong password to protect the interface!
admin_password: "change-me-to-something-secure"

# Warning intervals (minutes before lockout)
# Children will see on-screen notifications at these intervals
warning_intervals:
  - 5   # 5 minutes warning
  - 1   # 1 minute warning

# How often to check time limits
# Lower values = more accurate but more CPU usage
check_interval: 30s

# Grace period after limit before hard lock
# Gives children time to save work after the final warning
grace_period: 1m
